## Introduction

Monitoring is a crucial part of DevOps. As a tech start up grows, we aim to better prepare our organization for enterprise customers who prioritize software reliability and service. Our goal is to eventually establish Service Level Objectives (SLOs) for our applications and infrastructure.

With this objective in mind, I searched the internet and shortlisted 12 tools. I signed up for free trials for most of them and took notes along the way.

Given our small team, with only one dedicated DevOps staff member handling a broad range of requirements, here are some key aspects to focus on when comparing these products:

1. Comprehensive features: We want to integrate as many people as possible onto the platform to reduce silos between Development and Operations.
2. Beginner-friendly: With limited in-house educational resources, the UI should ideally be intuitive and self-explanatory.
3. Low operational effort: With only one DevOps staff member, the tool should require minimal maintenance.
4. Cost-effective: We need to ensure that our observability tools are affordable and within budget.

## Conclusion

Datadog is a well-rounded product that can effectively bridge the gap between development and operations. However, its notoriously high costs are a significant concern.

NewRelic offers a middle ground between proprietary and open-source products. It is much more affordable than Datadog while providing similar features, and we can still benefit from their engineering support.

Signoz is the ideal choice if we want to adopt an open-source product and potentially self-host it in the future. Its use of ClickHouse for data storage aligns well with our operational goals.
