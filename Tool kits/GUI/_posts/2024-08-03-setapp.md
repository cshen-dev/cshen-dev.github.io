I came across SetApp and highly recommend it to all Mac users. Think of it as a subscription that gives you access to a curated collection of the most useful Mac apps - like having a chef’s selection of software. So far, it’s the best value-for-money subscription I’ve ever purchased.

That said, it’s not ideal for enterprise use, as macOS itself isn’t particularly enterprise-ready. For instance, most mature MDM solutions don’t support iCloud subscriptions, and Apple doesn’t offer robust iCloud Drive management. Since many of the Mac-native apps in SetApp rely on iCloud, this can be a limitation.

With that in mind, I strongly recommend this subscription to indie developers or small tech startups, where data governance isn’t subject to heavy regulation.
