## Shell Evolution and Feature Comparison

### Bourne Shell (sh)

The original Unix shell developed by Stephen Bourne at Bell Labs in 1979:

- Minimalist design with essential shell functionality
- Focus on scripting rather than interactive use
- Limited job control
- No command history
- No command line editing
- Basic built-in commands only
- POSIX-compliant (original reference implementation)

### Bash (Bourne Again Shell)

Developed by Brian Fox for the GNU Project in 1989:

- Direct extension of the Bourne shell
- Strong focus on POSIX compliance
- Enhanced scripting capabilities
- Command history and editing
- Job control
- Programmable completion
- Array support
- More advanced parameter expansion

### Zsh (Z Shell)

Developed by Paul Falstad in 1990:

- Extended feature set beyond Bash
- Modular design with loadable modules
- Highly customizable
- Advanced pattern matching and globbing
- Theming capabilities
- Spelling correction
- Sophisticated tab completion system
- Floating point arithmetic
- More extensive string handling
- Better interactive features

## Key Functional Differences

1. **Core Commands**:
   - **sh**: Provides minimalist but essential commands
   - **Bash**: Extends sh with interactive features
   - **Zsh**: Further extends with advanced customization
2. **Variable Handling**:
   - **sh**: Basic variable support
   - **Bash**: Added arrays and better variable manipulation
   - **Zsh**: Added specialized variable types (integer, float)
3. **Command Completion**:
   - **sh**: None or minimal
   - **Bash**: Programmable completion system
   - **Zsh**: Advanced, context-aware completion system
4. **Scripting Capabilities**:
   - **sh**: Basic scripting support
   - **Bash**: Enhanced scripting with more built-ins
   - **Zsh**: Most extensive scripting capabilities
