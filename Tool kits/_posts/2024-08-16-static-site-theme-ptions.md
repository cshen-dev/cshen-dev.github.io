title: "Static site theme options"
---

Building a static site is a common need—marketing is persuasive, and a website remains one of the cheapest yet most effective channels. You might create a site to market your business, build your personal brand, promote an open-source project, launch a self-funded product, or simply share knowledge. Even when the goal isn’t explicitly marketing, in some way it often ends up serving that purpose.

Since you don’t really need a database, a static site is usually the most convenient and cost-effective solution.

Here are some curated static site theme options. As a developer who values data ownership, I’ve focused on technical solutions that give you full control.
