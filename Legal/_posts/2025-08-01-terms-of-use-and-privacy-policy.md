title: "The Two Most Common Legal Documents: Terms of Use and Privacy Policy"
---

## Intro

The Terms of Use and Privacy Policy are two of the most essential documents for any commercial software product.

## Terms of Use

### What it is

A Terms of Use is a contract between the software provider and its users. It governs how the software can be used, what is prohibited, what rights users have, and how disputes are handled.

### Why we need it

Legal Protection
- Helps define and limit your legal liability
- Sets clear boundaries to avoid misuse
- Can enforce user bans or access limitations if needed

## Privacy Policy

### What it is

A Privacy Policy is a legal document that explains how a company collects, uses, stores, shares, and protects user data. It outlines what kind of personal and non-personal information is gathered and for what purposes.

### Why we need it

Most countries (e.g., under GDPR in the EU, CCPA in California, Privacy Act in Australia) require a clear, accessible privacy policy if you collect any kind of personal information.

## Summary

You cannot launch a commercial SaaS product without both documents. Even for MVPs, having boilerplate versions tailored to your service is essential.
