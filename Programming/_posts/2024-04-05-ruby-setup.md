Ruby was once the dominant language among tech startups, largely due to the success of Ruby on Rails. GitHub itself began as a Ruby-based project.

With a philosophy centered on developer happiness, Ruby embodies the Japanese ideals of simplicity and refinement.

While its usage has declined with the emergence of type-safe languages and AI technologies, I still consider it an excellent choice for personal or hobby projects.
