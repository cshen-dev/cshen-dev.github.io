Welcome to my blog!

If you’ve landed here—hello and thanks for visiting.

A little about me: I’m someone who’s lucky enough to enjoy working in IT. I’m exploring different paths on my journey to becoming a fully independent full-stack developer.

Right now, I’m focused on sharpening my operational skills and spending a lot of time on programming, cloud computing, and AI.

The list below tracks my personal progress across various roles I’ve taken on:
- Android Developer
- Frontend Engineer
- Backend Engineer
- DevOps Engineer
- Indie Developer (in progress!)

**Disclaim:** Some of the content here has been polished with the help of a language model (LLM) to improve clarity and tone.
